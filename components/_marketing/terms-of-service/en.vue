        </p>
        <h3>6. Acceptable Use of the Site and Services</h3>
        <p>
          You are responsible for your use of the Site and Services, and for any use of
          the Site or Services made using your account. Our goal is to create a positive,
          useful, and safe user experience. To promote this goal, we prohibit certain
          kinds of conduct that may be harmful to other users or to us. When you use the
          Site or Services, you may not:

            including spyware, designed to collect data from the Site or Services;
          </li>
          <li>
            transmit any viruses or other computer instructions or technological means
            whose purpose is to disrupt, damage, or interfere with the use of computers or
            related systems;

          </li>
          <li>use any means to scrape or crawl any Web pages contained in the Site;</li>
          <li>
            attempt to circumvent any technological measure implemented by us or any of
            our providers or any other third party (including another user) to protect the
            Site or Services;
          </li>
          <li>
            attempt to decipher, decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer any of the
            software or other underlying code used to provide the Site or Services; or
          </li>
          <li>
            advocate, encourage, or assist any third party in doing any of the foregoing.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>7. User Content</h3>
        <p>
          The Site and some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send, or
          receive content and data (“<strong>User Content</strong>”). You retain ownership
          of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that User Content.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you upload, submit, store, send, or receive User Content to or through the
          Site or Services, you give us permission to reproduce and use your User Content
          as follows: you grant to us and those we work with a license to use, host,
          store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as translations,
          adaptations, or other changes we make so that User Content works better with the
          Site and Services), publicly perform, publicly display, and distribute your User
          Content. Our license to your User Content is non-exclusive, meaning you may use
          the User Content for your own purposes or let others use your User Content for
          their purposes. This license is fully-paid and royalty free, meaning we do not
          owe you anything else in connection with our use of your User Content. We may
          exercise our rights under this license anywhere in the world. Lastly, this
          license is perpetual, meaning that our rights under this license continue even
          after you stop using the Site and Services. In general, however, we will only
          need to use your User Content for as long as you choose to store it with us
          using the Site or Services.
        </p>
        <p>You promise that:</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>
            you own all rights to your User Content or, alternatively, that you have the
            right to give us the rights described above; and
          </li>
          <li>
            your User Content does not infringe the intellectual property rights, privacy
            rights, publicity rights, or other legal rights of any third party.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We may refuse to accept or transmit User Content for any reason. We may remove
          User Content from the Site or Services for any reason. Users will have an
          opportunity to flag User Content that may violate our Terms. We reserve the
          right (but you agree that we do not have an obligation) to review such User
          Content and remove it at our discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may provide you with the ability to delete your User Content. When you delete
          your User Content, however, it may continue to exist elsewhere on our systems in
          circumstances where your User Content is re-posted by another user on his or her
          page; where immediate deletion would prevent us from complying with the law,
          complying with the request of a judicial or administrative authority, law
          enforcement or a government agency; and where immediate deletion would prevent
          us from investigating or identifying a violation of these Terms. In any of the
          foregoing circumstances, deleted User Content will be retained for no longer
          than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained.
        </p>
        <h3>8. Ownership</h3>
        <p>
          Other than User Content, we own or license all right, title, and interest in and
          to (a) the Site and Services, including all software, text, media, and other
          content available on the Site and Services (“<strong>Our Content</strong>”); and
          (b) our trademarks, logos, and brand elements (“<strong>Marks</strong>”). The
          Site and Services, Our Content, and Marks are all protected under U.S. and
          international laws. The look and feel of the Site and Services are copyright ©

        <p>
          For clarity, only copyright infringement notices should go to our Copyright
          Agent. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements
          of this section your notice may not be valid.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you believe the content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is
          not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the
          copyright owner&#x27;s agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use such
          content, you may submit a counter-notice to the address listed above containing
          the following information:
        </p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>Your physical or electronic signature;</li>
          <li>
            Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has
            been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was
            removed or disabled;
          </li>
          <li>
            A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or

          <li>
            Your name, physical address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement

            person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After we receive your counter-notification, we will forward it to the party who
          submitted the original claim of copyright infringement. Please note that when we
          forward the counter-notification, it includes your personal information. By
          submitting a counter-notification, you consent to having your information
          revealed in this way. We will not forward the counter-notification to any party
          other than the original claimant.
        </p>
        <p>
          After we send out the counter-notification, the claimant must then notify us
          within 10 days that he or she has filed an action seeking a court order to
          restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content that
          was removed or disabled. If we receive such notification we will be unable to
          restore the material. If we do not receive such notification, we may reinstate
          the material.

        </p>
        <h3>15. Arbitration Agreement &amp; Waiver of Certain Rights</h3>
        <p>
          You and Playlog agree that we will resolve any disputes between us through
          binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings. You and
          Playlog hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any Claim (defined below). All
          controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and
          Playlog (each a “<strong>Claim</strong>”) shall be submitted for binding
          arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association
          (“<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”). The arbitration will be heard and determined by
          a single arbitrator. The arbitrator&#x27;s decision in any such arbitration will
          be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of
          competent jurisdiction. The parties agree that the arbitration will be kept
          confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it
          (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs or other documents
          submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards)
          will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully
          be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or by applicable

          If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared
          to the costs of litigation, Playlog will pay as much of the administrative costs
          and arbitrator&#x27;s fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems
          necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the
          final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the
          compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the
          arbitrator deems appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
          This arbitration agreement does not preclude you or Playlog from seeking action
          by federal, state, or local government agencies. You and Playlog also have the
          right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court. In addition, you and
          Playlog retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for
          provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary
          injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with these
          Terms, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as
          provided in these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither you nor Playlog may act as a class representative or private attorney
          general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to
          any Claim. Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis. The
          arbitrator can decide only your and/or [Company Name]&rsquo;s individual Claims.
          The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or
          parties who may be similarly situated.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any provision of this Section is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then
          that specific provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed,
          but the remainder of this Section shall continue in full force and effect. No
          waiver of any provision of this Section of the Terms will be effective or
          enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a
          right or requirement. Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion
          of this Terms. This Section of the Terms will survive the termination of your
          relationship with Playlog.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT
          ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS
          OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN
          AAA RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. OTHER RIGHTS
          THAT YOU OR PLAYLOG WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN
          ARBITRATION.

          Under no circumstances will we be held liable for any delay or failure in

        <p>
          If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful or unenforceable, then
          that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the
          enforceability of any other provisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The failure by us to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not
          prevent us from enforcing such right or provision in the future.

        <p>
          We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms, including in
          connection with a merger, acquisition, sale of assets or equity, or by operation
          of law.
        </p>
